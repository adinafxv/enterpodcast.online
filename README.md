# enterpodcast.online
### Very basic temporary website for [enterpodcast.online](https://enterpodcast.online)
Deploy status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4810411d-43a6-4709-9de7-5b084fb561c4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/enter-podcast/deploys)
used: twig, sass, gulp
Oldschool, but works for now. Will focus on content first.

Whatâ€˜s next?
- simple website that will allow me to easily publish new pages for topics or episodes
- ideally with every new episode, I want to add a new entry to json and let the app do its magic
